flusim-simjava
==============

Hello,

This simulation software constituted the work for my Masters in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Texas at Arlington, Texas, USA under the direction of Drs Sajal Das and Richard H. Scheuermann as well as Kalyan Basu.

This software requires the simjava 2.0 software found [here.](http://www.icsa.inf.ed.ac.uk/research/groups/hase/simjava/) SimJava is licenses under a separate license.

In summary this project was an attempt to create the first molecular level model of influenza virus infection along with a discrete event stochastic simulation. They years were 2004 to 2008 and much of what we know about the dynamics of influenza infection did not exist. This model and simulation strives to create a qualitative model where much of the data to create a truly quantitative model was missing. 

The details of the model may be found in my Mater's thesis found [here.](https://www.academia.edu/809131/An_Influenza_Virus_Molecular_Infection_Model_And_Discrete_Event_Stochastic_Simulation)

Please let em know if you have any questions.

Regards,

R. Burke Squires
